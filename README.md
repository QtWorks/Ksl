KSL
===

KSL is a free (LGPL3) C++/Qt library with utilities for science. Our
goal is to mimic the set of tools NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib from
Python down here in the world of C++ performance.

KSL provides a widget to visualize data as many forms of charts. It also
provides classes that executes various machine learning and data-related
tasks like:

   * Linear regression
   * Maximization and minimization

The numerical routines in KSL are adapted from the Mighty GNU Scientific Library
[GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl)
We thank and congratulate it's developers for the great work.
Ksl follows some of KDE's software design goals and all of it's philosophy but it
is not an official KDE component.
