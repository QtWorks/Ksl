KSL
===

KSL is a free (LGPL3) C++/Qt library with utilities for science. Our
goal is to mimic the set of tools NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib from
Python down here in the world of C++ performance.

KSL provides already provides facilities for array manipulation and data
visualization and more tools specially for data science related tasks are
being developed. KSL actually provides:

   * Data Visualization Widget
   * Linear Regression
   * Maximization and Minimization

The numerical routines in KSL are adapted from the Mighty GNU Scientific Library
[GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl)
We thank and congratulate it's developers for the great work.
Ksl follows some of KDE's software design goals and all of it's philosophy but it
is not an official KDE component.

The figures below ware created with KSL's chart widget:
