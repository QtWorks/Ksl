QSL
===

QSL is a free (LGPL3) C++/Qt library with utilities for science. Our
goal is to mimic the set of tools NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib from
Python down here in the world of C++ performance.

QSL provide a widget to visualize data as many forms of charts. It also
provides classes that executes various machine learning and data-related
tasks like:

   * Linear Regression
   * Maximization and minimization

The following figure shows a screenshot of one of the demo apps bundled
together with QSL. It shows our chart widget and a line from the linear
regression class that best represents the data points shown.

The numerical routines in QSL are ported from the Mighty GNU Scientific Library
[(GSL)]: www.gnu.org/software/gsl
We thank and congratulate it's developers for the great work.
