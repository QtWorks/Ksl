KSL
===

KSL is a free (LGPL3) C++/Qt library with utilities for science. Our goal
is to provide tools to facilitade and make fast the development of programs
for data analisys and information retrieval. We start with simple array
handling and linear regression as well as a fast and featureful chart
widget for visualization.

KSL's (growing) list of current features is:

   * Data Visualization Widget
   * Linear Regression

The numerical routines in KSL are primarily adapted from the Mighty GNU
Scientific Library [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl)
We thank and congratulate it's developers for the great work. Ksl follows
some of KDE's software design goals and all of it's philosophy but it is
not an official KDE component.

The figures below ware created with KSL's chart widget:

   * Sine function (on Debian8/KDE)

   * Particles in a box of edge length L (on Windows 7)
